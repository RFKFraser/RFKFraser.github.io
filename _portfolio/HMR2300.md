A while ago I was browsing a national second-hand goods marketplace when i came across a liquidation sale for Martin Jetpack.
Martin Jetpack was a NZ based company developing a 200 horsepower, petrol engine, ducted fan jetpack. From 2008 they spent 11 years developing these jetpacks untill they wound up the company. 
The jetpacks were undeniably cool. The team were essentially just strapping a motobike engine to your back and pointing two huge fans at the ground, thats Wile E. Coyote shit. There are some videos floating around with demos of the jetpacks and they are completely nuts. 

Anyway... I managed to get my hands on a *very* cheap HMR2300 magnetometer in the liquidation sale.
I was pretty excited about it because these things go for **$2900** NZD, and they are [still available](https://www.digikey.co.nz/en/products/detail/honeywell-aerospace/HMR2300-D21-485/334174).
It was likely used as an attitude sensor / compass for the jetpacks as it can easily sense the earths magnetic field.
