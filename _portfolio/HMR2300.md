A while ago i was browsing a national second-hand goods marketplace when i came across a liquidation sale for Martin Jetpack. Martin Jetpack was a NZ based company developing a 200 horsepower, petrol engine powered, ducted fan jetpack. From 2008 they spent 20 years developing these jetpacks untill they wound it up after failing to find success. The jetpacks were undeniably cool. They were essentially just strapping a motobike engine to your back and pointing two huge fans at the ground, thats Wile E. Coyote shit. There are some videos floating around with demos of the jetpacks and they are completely nuts. 
Anyway... I managed to get my hands on a *very* cheap HMR2300 magnetometer in the liquidation sale.
It was most likely used as an attitude sensor for the jetpacks as it is sensitive enough to be used to detect the earths magnetic field.
