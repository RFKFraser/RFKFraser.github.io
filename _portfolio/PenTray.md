In 2024 completed a project to design and manufacture a pen tray desk accessory. 
As a stationary nerd and engineer it was a fun experience to dive into a project where i could focus on form. I wanted to utalise folded sheet aluminium as it is a cost effective medium with the potential to present a premium feel. 

After some cAD (cardboard aided design) and some CAD i had a design ready to manufacture. 
I visited a local sheet metal fabrication workshop which i had used extensively through Foundry Lab, and with their help i got some prototypes made.

The parts came from the workshop in a natural finish with no deburring or finishing applied. 
After a hour or two in a parts tumbler the parts came out with a nice even finish, even managing to remove the tooling marks (which i was surprised by).

From there i could paint! 
After an etch primer, a top coat and a clear satin protective coating the parts were finished.

Unfortunatly they lacked a premium feel, too rattly and raw feeling still. 

I decided they needed a liner, either in felt or cork. 
After finding some cork sheeting meant to be used as a flooring underlay and a quick profile on the laser cutter, a tester liner was done.

The finished prototype delivers on its intent and i have been enjoying using them for both work and home.

I particularly like the corner reliefs in the folded sheet. The flange seperation allows rulers, paper or card to be slotted in, although this is an after thought and i dont particularly like the way it looks.

Ongoing:
I have enquired with a local powder coater and grabbed some colour samples. Powder coating is the method i would prefer to use rather than paint (even though its overkill for a desk accessory) due to its durable, high quality factory finish. A minor drawback to powder coating is the need for a small hole in the part so they can hang it from a hook for spraying and setting. This would be consealed on the inside by the liner, and some well placed rubber feet on the underside.
