Hey i'm Ronan, i’m a mechanical engineer and product designer with a focus on creating well-considered, functional tools, both physical and digital. My work sits at the intersection of engineering precision and design intuition, driven by a strong belief that good tools should be both effective and a pleasure to use.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to a range of projects—from early-stage prototyping to production ready systems, often working across disciplines to bring ideas from concept to reality. I’m particularly interested in solving complex problems with simple, elegant solutions, and I enjoy working hands-on throughout the development process.

I’m currently based in Wellington, NZ, after just finishing up a 5-year sprint with Foundry Lab - trying to solve metal casting
