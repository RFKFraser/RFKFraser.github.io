Hey I'm Ronan, 
I’m a mechatronics engineer with a focus on creating well-considered tools, both physical and digital. I like to think my work sits at the intersection of engineering precision and design intuition, driven by a strong belief that good tools should be both effective and a pleasure to use.

I’ve contributed to a range of projects, from early-stage prototyping to production ready systems, often working across disciplines to bring ideas from concept to reality. I’m particularly interested in solving complex problems with simple solutions, and I enjoy working hands-on throughout the development process.

I’m currently based in Wellington, NZ, and I'm just finishing up a 5-year sprint with Foundry Lab solving metal casting.

I'm looking for new opportunities!
I would love to sink my teeth into a robotics heavy role and that is where i will be actively pursuing work.
